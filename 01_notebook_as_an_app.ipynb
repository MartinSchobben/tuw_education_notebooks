In the case of flood mapping we have $\\sigma^0$ backscatter observations over land (effect) and we want to deduce the probability of flooding (F) and non-flooding (NF). \n",

These so-called \"posteriors\" need on more piece of information as can be seen in the equation above. We need the probability whether a pixel is flooded $P(F)$ or non-flooded $P(NF)$. We can of course not estimate this information precisely, so our best estimate is that the chance of flooding versus non-flooding of a pixel is 50-50: a coin flip. This subjective prior believe is a fundament of Bayesian statistics and we use the likelihood to updated our believe in this particular hypothesis. We now can also calculate the probability of backscattering $P(\\sigma^0)$, as the weighted average of the water and land likelihoods. The latter ensures that our updated evidence (or posteriors) ranges between 0 to 1.\n",
